# Semiotic Standard for Kerbal Vessels

This is a set of decals for Kerbal Space Program based on the Semiotic Standard icons designed by Ron Cobb for the movie Alien. 
The pack includes two decal part for both the Alien and Moon icon sets, making use of the part variants mechanic introduced
in version 1.4. 

There are currently 52 icons, including the original set of 34 icons designed by Ron Cobb, an additional 2
icons in the same art style, and 16 icons from the movie Moon, designed by Gavin Rothery. Each icon is a 128x128 texture so it
they shouldnt have a very big impact on memory.

Feel free to bundle this pack with other mods to reference the textures, as long as the `Semiotic/` directory remains in the 
root gamedata folder to prevent duplication.
